   - Campaigns like 'youtube_blogger' and 'banner_partner' show high efficiency in converting spend to revenue.

2. **Funnel Optimization Opportunities:**

   - The 'search' category, contributing 8.64% of revenue, might benefit from optimization or increased budget allocation.

4. **Temporal Trends:**
   - The significant order spike followed by a decline in late February warrants investigation into potential causes (e.g., promotional event, external factors) and strategies to sustain performance.

5. **Campaign-specific Insights:**
   - 'instagram_tier2' excels at lead generation but has lower order conversion, indicating a need for improved lead qualification or follow-up processes.
